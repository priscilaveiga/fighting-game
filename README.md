# Fighting-game

 This is my first game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS as a study project, based on [this amazing tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ) by Chris Courses -  I highly recommend it for everyone starting with coding.

 
 It's a two players fighting game with the following features:

 * ⏲️ round countdown;
 * 🔋  health bar;
 * ✨ scenario and characters animation

 and...

🥊 You can play with a friend using the keyboard!!
